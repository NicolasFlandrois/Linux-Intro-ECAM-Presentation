# A few exemples (weird) of uses of Linux

- Crock Pot (Linux Powered IoT devise, Automated & connected auto pressure coocker)
- Smart Expresso Machine
- ISS (International Space Station)
- Robots (ROS - AI framework Linux based). e.g. Boston Dynamix
- [Large Hadron Collider CERN (Suisse)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider)
- Nuclear Submarine
    + Lockheed Martin Class (USA)
    + Sonnar system
- Electric Motorcycle - Mavizen TTX02
- Delaval cow milker
- Smart TV / Smart TV remote control
- Super computer/Cluster computer (e.g. Watson)
- Airplane Entertainment Screens
- Tracking Point 338TP - Computer assisted Viseur pour Fusil long distance
- Google's self driving car
- Windows' WSL
- Chromebook
- Microsoft's AZURE servers
- San Francisco Traffic Control
- Underwater Tsunami Sensors
- Fast Food Menu Display, Tim Horton's Donuts (Canada)
- Gas Station Display
- Titanium Surf Robot (Currents and Waves sensor, automated robot)
- Lyon Miniworld Venissieu, System de controle du parc miniworld & des traffics de trains miniatures.
- All and Any Raspberry pi DIY projects around the world. expl:
    + Raspberry pi Smart Mirror
    + Raspberry pi server
    + Raspberry pi 3D printer
    + Raspberry pi ...
- RED STAR OS
    + South Korea Official OS
    + Based on Fedora
    + Mac OS display look, central app bar
    + ATTENTION DO NOT USE THIS OS
- "Special" OS (for fun!):
    + Ubuntu Satanic Edition
    + Ubuntu Christian Edition
    + Hannah Montanna Linux
    + Justin Bibber Linux
- Tesla car - Model S
- Drones (Commercials ou DIY)
- Ville d'Oullins (fr - 69):
    + Officially using Libre Office in City Hall administration
    + Ecole maternelle == Linux (Partly knows this because I installed it)
- Schools/University/Hobbyists clubs around the world. expl:
    + Rocket Clubs
    + Weather Baloons
    + Remote controled planes/Miniatures
- Some Cities in Germany uses Linux for all administration agencies.
- Formula 1 Team of engineers (Linux + Python):
    - [At least, as far as I know; Teams: Redbull, and 1 Italian Team]
    - Cluster computers to :
        - compute models for carbon fiber molds
        - compute data analyses from lab tests:
            - Wind Tube
            - all, any, and every technical data
            - Simulations
    - On board computer:
        - dynamic data provided in real time during the race
    - Real exemple of Open Source in Engineering world:
        - If licence base softwares, the use is limited by the licence. The licence is binded to the computer (MAC Address).
        - If for xyz reason 1 of the team computer breaks down the day before the race (or on D-day). Licences are still attached to old PC. And therefor unusable on emergency PC.
        - With open software, the team is up and runing in no time. No Licence shortage, or Licence Binding limitatiuons.
- [SpaceX's Falcon 9](https://fossbytes.com/spacex-used-linux-to-send-nasa-astronauts-to-international-space-station/)
- [PSA Peugeot CitroÃ«n depuis 2007 utilise Linux (Most likely the onboard OS in cars are also Linux Based

)](https://fr.wikinews.org/wiki/PSA_Peugeot_Citro%C3%ABn_migre_vers_Linux)
